# VERSION CJE 3/20/2023
# Analysis file for gromacs runs of amphipathic helix with lipid bilayer
structure: production_block1.tpr # Structure file for the run
trajectory: traj_continuous_v1_3.xtc # Trajectory for the run. Note, this needs to have all of the atoms for now
gromacs: production_block1.gro # Gromacs equivalent of the structure file, needed because mdtraj and mdanalysis take in different files
plumed:
  reference_file: reference.pdb # Reference PDB file for the helix definition
  plumed_file: plumed_measure_postprocess.dat # PLUMED file name for analysis
  colvar_file: colvar_processed.dat # PLUMED output data name for analysis
  masscharge_file: mcfile.dat # Charge and mass file from GROMACS
  alpha_residues: 1-18 # What residues are the alpha helix
  # lipid_P_atoms are the phosphorus atoms in the lipid bialyer, need to extract from the trajectories/structure
  # helix_C_atoms are the carbon atoms for C_alpha in the helix, need to extract from the trajectories/structure
